    "    1. Represent the hits of a query with a wordcloud of 25-50 informative words. The wordcloud should somehow summarise what the collection has to say about the query. You may think of these words as words that you could add to the query in order to improve recall (blind relevance feedback/query expansion).\n",
    "    2. Represent each document (a kamervraag) with a word-cloud. Also make word-clouds for the question and for the answer. EXAMPLE: The html files in http://data.politicalmashup.nl/arjan/odeii/data_as_html/ contain such wordcloud summaries, which work rather well.   \n",
