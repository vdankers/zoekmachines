De URL linked door naar de nieuwe url http://www.delpher.nl/nl/kranten/view?identifier=ddd%3A010563762%3Ampeg21%3Aa0005&coll=ddd ElasticSearch gebruikt een JSON formaat als invoer, en dit is dus triviaal om te zetten naar JSON.\n",

    "* Advanced search. Let a user be able to search in several fields, also in several fields simulteanously. Queries like \"return kamervragen by Wilders about XXX with an answer about YYY in the period ZZZ\" should be possible. (For the \"Telegraaf\" collectie, let the user search in both title and tekst fields)\n",
    "* Do one of the following:\n",
    "    1. Represent the hits of a query with a wordcloud of 25-50 informative words. The wordcloud should somehow summarise what the collection has to say about the query. You may think of these words as words that you could add to the query in order to improve recall (blind relevance feedback/query expansion).\n",
    "    2. Represent each document (a kamervraag) with a word-cloud. Also make word-clouds for the question and for the answer. EXAMPLE: The html files in http://data.politicalmashup.nl/arjan/odeii/data_as_html/ contain such wordcloud summaries, which work rather well.   \n",
